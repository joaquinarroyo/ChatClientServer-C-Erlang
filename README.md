Authors: joaquinarroyo and NachoCainelli

Implementation of a chat with the client server model in C and Erlang. The client is implemented in C, and the server in Erlang.

The server will be started with the command 'server: start ().', After compiling the server module; and the client will start with the command './cliente 127.0.0.1 port' (on the server the constant port is defined with 1234), after having compiled the program with the command 'make client'.
